Got it! Here's a more informal and straight-to-the-point README, designed for showcasing your work in a resume-style manner:

# Python Hacking Practice - Personal Projects

This repo contains a bunch of **Python scripts** I wrote as part of my personal **ethical hacking practice**. These scripts cover basic cybersecurity techniques like network scanning, spoofing, brute-forcing, and SQL injections. I created these for learning purposes and to get hands-on experience with ethical hacking tools.

## What’s Inside

- **ARP & ICMP Scanners** – For finding devices in the network.
- **Port Scanners** – Fast and simple port scanning techniques.
- **Spoofing Scripts** – ARP and DNS spoofers for MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks.
- **Brute-Force Scripts** – SSH and web login brute-forcers.
- **Hash Cracking** – Cracking SHA256 hashes.
- **SQL Injection** – Automated SQL injection tool.
- **Packet Sniffer** – Captures packets using Scapy.

## How to Use

1. **Clone this repo**:
   ```bash
   


Install dependencies:
pip install scapy requests



Run a script:
Example for running ARP spoofer:
python ARP_spoofer.py




Purpose
These scripts are just for practice. I built them to learn different hacking and security techniques using Python. They are not ready for production and should only be used for educational purposes. Don't go using them on anything you don’t have permission to test.

License
Feel free to use and modify these scripts for learning. No guarantees, though — use at your own risk.

This version is casual and to the point. It's more about showing what you've done rather than explaining it in a formal manner. How’s this?

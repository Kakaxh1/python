### Project Title
Python-based Simple Port Scanner

### Introduction
This report details the development of a Python-based port scanner. The tool is designed to scan target IP addresses or domains for open ports.

### Technical Implementation
The port scanner utilizes the socket library to establish connections to target ports. The script iterates through a specified port range, attempting to connect to each port. If a connection is successful, the port is considered open.

### Results and Evaluation
The port scanner has been successfully tested against various IP addresses and domains. It accurately identifies open ports and provides informative output. The tool's simplicity and efficiency make it a valuable asset for network security professionals.

### Conclusion
The Python-based port scanner is a practical tool for network security assessments. Its straightforward implementation and effective functionality demonstrate the power of Python for network security tasks.
